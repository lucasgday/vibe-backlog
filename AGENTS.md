# Vibe-Backlog Contract (must)

Before coding:
- Run: `vibe preflight`
- Work must be associated to a GitHub issue.

After finishing a work turn:
- Produce `.vibe/artifacts/postflight.json` matching the schema (coming soon)
- Run: `vibe postflight` to validate + sync tracker updates (append-only)
- Never overwrite user notes; only append under "Agent log" sections.
