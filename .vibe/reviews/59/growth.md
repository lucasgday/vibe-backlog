- Launch loop benefit: auto-closing resolved follow-ups reduces backlog noise and improves triage signal for CLI dogfooding.
- Instrumentation gap: we currently do not count close attempts/success/failure rates across runs.
- Suggested follow-up hypothesis: add lightweight metrics in summary/comment stream to track auto-close success ratio over time.
