## Run 2026-02-19T14:36:52.818Z
- run_id: issue-73-pr-74-attempt-1
- attempt: 1/5
- findings: 0
- autofix_applied: no

### Summary
Assumption: CLI/text-only surface (monospace, 16px-equivalent body, line-by-line scan). Information architecture is mostly consistent, but the severity/counter mismatch creates a hierarchy/comprehension issue in the summary block.

### Findings
- none

- run_id: issue-73-pr-74-attempt-2
- attempt: 1/5
- findings: 0
- autofix_applied: no

### Summary
Assumption: CLI/text-only interface (monospace output, 16px-equivalent body). The summary block now preserves clearer information hierarchy by aligning severity with displayed lifecycle unresolved totals.

### Findings
- none
